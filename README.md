# Simple AI

Welcome to another one of my weekend projects exploring how humans can interact with state of the art AI models. This week explores what it would be like to interact with many models through only a text input and minimalistic UI. Just type what you want to do. Anything is fair game ;). Built using zustand, nextjs, cloudflare workers, framer motion, StabilityAI API, and OpenAI API.

## Contributing

Just make a PR and try to follow the functional paradigm. All skill levels welcome. Let's build AI interactions together :).
